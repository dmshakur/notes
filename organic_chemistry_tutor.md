## Simplifying exponents with fractions, variables, negative exponents, multiplication & division

When multiplying two numbers with exponents, the exponents are added together, example: $x^4x^{-9}=x^{-5}=\frac{1}{x^5}$.
When you get a negative exponent convert it to a positive exponent and make it the denominator of a fraction with a numerator of $1$.

With two numbered exponents, where one is inside of parenthses and the exponent is applied to the parenthses, the exponents are multiplied, for example: $(x^3)^{-5}=x^{-15}=\frac{1}{x^{15}}$.

When you have a fraction with exponents you subtract them, for example: $\frac{x^7}{x^{12}}=x^{-5}=\frac{1}{x^5}$.

When you multiply exponents with the distributive property you multiply the exponent by every exponent in the parentheses, for example: $(3x^2)^3=(3^3x^6)=27x^6$. When doing this if the number has a negative but no exponent, the exponent of 1 added to that number, has the number itself remain negative with parenthses around it, like so: $(-xy^2)=(-x)^2(y^4)$.

Anything to the exponent of 0 is 1.
