
# Limitless by Jim Kwik

I resolve to finish this book and notes so that I can further myself and my dreams in an undying effort to become who I want to be and live a life that I want to live. I commit to reading this book in 25 minute increments so that I am able to retain as much information as possible and truly learn the material. I will forget my prior understandings, distractions, and limiting beliefs. I commit to the active process. I will take notes and do all the quick start exercises. I will practice. I will ask myself relevant questions as I read and manage my state of being. I will check on my well being and energy levels. I commit to review what I have already learned, so that I will not forget it and I will remember it. I commit that even if I mess up with any of the above I won't beat myself up, I will get back at it and do my best. I am ready to be limitless, the questions are the answer.

Don't look everything up on google or use other tools to do brain work for you, this will cause your brain exercise itself.
Your brain will not get stronger if it does not work.

Our brain is capable of changing structure over time, this is called neuroplasticity.
Remembering is maintaining and sustaining brain connections.

When you fail to remember something it can be seen as a failure to make a connection in your brain.
If you learn something and think that is not of valuable or that you find it important, you may not remember it because of your attitude.

There is no limitation to what you can do when you apply the right mindset, motivation and methods.

The CNS (Central nervous system) and ENS (Endocrine nervous system) are both connected by the vagus nerve. The ENS system is thought of as the second brain. It produces a lot of the same transmitters as the brain, such as, dopamine, seratonin, and acetyl-choline.

Information caused by emotion lasts longer.

## Chapter 4: How to read and remember this book and any book
Research shows that 50% of people forget what they learn within an hour, and 70% forget within a day.

If we spend anywhere outside 10-40 minutes of time on a single task, we will lose focus and our return will lessen.

You are more likely to remember the last and first thing that you learn, primacy and recency. By taking breaks you create more beginning and endings.

Whenever you read any book you have the opportunity to stretch the range of your mind and it will never be the same.

The FASTER method:
* Forget:
  * The key to laser focus is to remove or forget that which distracts you.
  * Forget what you already know so that you aren't held back by preconceived notions of the way things work.
  * Approach learning with a "beginners mind", the mind is like a parachute: It only works if open.
  * Suspend at least temporarily what you believe is possible.
* Act:
  * Learning is not a spectator sport. Use resources and tools to actively learn instead of passively learning.
* State:
  * Your current state is a snapshot of your emotions.
  * When you tie an emotion or other sense you are able to create long term memories.
* Teach:
  * When you teach someone something you are more likely to remember it in more detail, because you are accountable for their learning, and must be able to answer any questions they might have.
* Enter:
  * 
* Review:

> Take a moment before each learning session to remember and put your thoughts out on what you previously learned.

Questions are the answer.

Once something breaks through your awareness you recognize it anywhere you see it, which may be many different places.

The questions we ask ourselves can dominate our lives and the way we live them. If we ask ourselves disheartening questions then we too shall be disheartened.

#### Quick start: What is one dominant question that you ask yourself:
When will this all be over?

When reading you need to prep yourself. Asking questions that you might find the answers to later on as you're reading.

#### Questions that you can ask yourself before reading.
1. How can I use this?
2. Why must I use this?
3. When will I use this?

Every time you answer a questions you rewire your brain.

## Part II: Limitless mindset: The what
At some point we have an experience that gives us an impression of what we are capable of, this can be called learned helplessness in psychology.
LIE
* Limited
* Idea
* Entertained
With great responsibility come great power. We must be held accountable for what we become.
