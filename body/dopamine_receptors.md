## Supplements to repair dopamine receptors
### Uridine
* Found in beer. 
* Evidence of modulating dopamine levels via upregulation of stiatal D-2 receptors.
* Can be supplemented with:
    * Triacetyluridine <- This is the more bioavailable form, thus requires a lower dose 
    * Uridine monophosphate

### Forskolin
Primary bioactive ingredient in the herb, *Coleus forskohlii*. Research suggests that it may be able to potently upreguate dopamine receptors via increasing cAMP levels.

> cAMP (Cyclic adenosine monophosphate): is a second messenger important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intra-cellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway.

### Sulbutiamine
Basically, a more bioavailable version of thiamine. Research suggests that sulbutiamine modulates the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and gluatmatergic transmission systems, and upregulates both D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors.

### Inositol
A natural B vitamin, B8. Evidence shows that it upregulates both serotonin and dopamine receptors. Safe dosages range from 6 grams to 18 grams. It is often paired with choline.

### CDP-Choline (Citocoline)
A precursor to acetylcholine. Mice given 100mg/kg daily over 7 months saw an 11% increase in D-2 dopamine receptor density, mice given 500mg/kg saw an 18% increase. Egg yolks are high in choline.

### ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine)
Simply a more neuro-active, acetylated version of the amino acid Carnitine. ALCAR upregulates D-1 receptors but does not effect D-2. It also seems to exert anti-depressent effects  via modulation of glutamate receptors.

### Cordyceps
There is evidence showing that cordyceps upregulates D-2 dopamine receptors and enhances the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine-hydroxylase that converts L-tyrosine to L-DOPA, which is then converted to dopamine.
